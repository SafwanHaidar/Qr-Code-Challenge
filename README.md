## My process
I started the project by setting up the basic HTML structure with semantic tags and linking the required Google Font. Then I added the QR code image, heading, and paragraph inside a container. For styling, I used CSS variables for colors, applied padding and border-radius. Finally, I polished the layout, tested it across browsers, and made sure it matched the original Frontend Mentor design as closely as possible.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Desktop first approach

### What I learned

This was my first project practice, and I learned a lot about using semantic HTML tags, organizing CSS properly, and styling a component to match a design.



### Continued development

I want to focus more on CSS because I faced some difficulties while adding styles to HTML elements.
